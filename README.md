## ✨ What is EventsHog?

**EventsHog** is a real-time event tracking backend you can host, customize, and scale — built with:

- 🧠 **NestJS** for a modular and dev-friendly architecture
- ⚙️ **Kafka** for unstoppable event streaming
- 🚀 **ClickHouse** for analytics queries that fly
- 🧩 Native support for **Flutter**, **React**, or anything with an HTTP client

> Think PostHog meets Supabase. Except it’s 100% yours.

## 🧨 Why EventsHog Exists

Because we were tired of:

- 🥵 Analytics tools that **cost more** as your app succeeds
- 🧱 Data stuck in black-box clouds you can't inspect or query freely
- 🧪 Tools built for marketers, not developers
- 🤷‍♂️ Not knowing what your users are doing after they sign up

So we built our own — focused on the **real developer journey**:
**From install → to usage → to conversions → to power users.**

## 🧠 What You Can Track

- 📲 App installs
- 📝 Signups & logins
- 🛍️ Feature usage & purchases
- 💬 Messages, chats, actions
- 🛑 Dropoffs & rage clicks
- 🎯 Custom goals & conversion paths

> All stitched together by `userId`, `sessionId`, `deviceId`, or whatever you want.
