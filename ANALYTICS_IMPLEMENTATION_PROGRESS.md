# EventsHog Analytics System Implementation Progress

## Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive analytics system that allows any app (including Kijiweni) to consume and analyze their event data from ClickHouse through EventsHog.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Core Analytics Infrastructure

- **Generic Analytics Interfaces**: Created flexible interfaces that work with any app's event structure
- **Analytics Repository**: Built ClickHouse query layer with security and performance optimizations
- **Analytics Service**: Implemented business logic for common analytics use cases
- **Analytics Controller**: Created REST API endpoints with comprehensive filtering and security

### 2. Key Features

- **Multi-dimensional Filtering**: Filter by time, user, device, platform, app version, and event type
- **Real-time Metrics**: Live insights into app performance and user activity
- **User Journey Analysis**: Track individual user behavior patterns and engagement
- **Content Performance**: Analyze content engagement and performance metrics
- **Error Analytics**: Monitor and analyze error patterns and user impact
- **Custom Queries**: Execute custom ClickHouse queries for specific business needs
- **Conversion Funnel Analysis**: Understand user conversion paths and drop-off points

### 3. Security & Performance

- **App Isolation**: All queries are scoped to the requesting app's data
- **Dual Authentication**: JWT + API key validation required
- **Query Validation**: Custom queries must include app_id filter for security
- **Optimized Queries**: Leverages ClickHouse's columnar storage for efficient analytics
- **Pagination**: Handles large result sets without memory issues

## API Endpoints Created

### Core Analytics

- `GET /analytics/events` - Get filtered events
- `GET /analytics/metrics` - Get comprehensive analytics metrics
- `GET /analytics/users/{userId}` - Get user-specific analytics
- `GET /analytics/events/{eventName}` - Get event-specific analytics

### Advanced Analytics

- `GET /analytics/real-time` - Get live metrics
- `GET /analytics/content-performance` - Analyze content engagement
- `GET /analytics/user-engagement` - Get user engagement metrics
- `GET /analytics/error-analytics` - Analyze error patterns
- `GET /analytics/conversion-funnel` - Get conversion funnel analysis

### Custom Analysis

- `POST /analytics/custom-query` - Execute custom ClickHouse queries

## How Kijiweni Can Use This System

### 1. Track User Behavior

```bash
# Get all user login events for the last 7 days
GET /analytics/events?appId=kijiweni&eventName=USER_LOGIN&startDate=2024-01-08T00:00:00Z&endDate=2024-01-15T23:59:59Z

# Analyze user engagement patterns
GET /analytics/user-engagement?appId=kijiweni&startDate=2024-01-01T00:00:00Z&endDate=2024-01-31T23:59:59Z
```

### 2. Monitor Content Performance

```bash
# Track episode engagement
GET /analytics/content-performance?appId=kijiweni&startDate=2024-01-01T00:00:00Z&endDate=2024-01-31T23:59:59Z

# Analyze specific episode performance
GET /analytics/events?appId=kijiweni&eventName=EPISODE_OPENED&startDate=2024-01-01T00:00:00Z&endDate=2024-01-31T23:59:59Z
```

### 3. Real-time Monitoring

```bash
# Get live user activity
GET /analytics/real-time?appId=kijiweni

# Monitor active users and events per minute
```

### 4. Custom Analysis

```bash
# Execute custom queries for specific business needs
POST /analytics/custom-query
{
  "appId": "kijiweni",
  "query": "SELECT event_name, count() as count FROM events WHERE app_id = 'kijiweni' AND event_name LIKE '%EPISODE%' GROUP BY event_name ORDER BY count DESC"
}
```

## Technical Architecture

### Data Flow

1. **EventsHog** → **Kafka** → **ClickHouse** (existing)
2. **Analytics API** → **ClickHouse** → **Response** (newly implemented)

### Security Layers

1. **JWT Authentication**: User identity verification
2. **API Key Validation**: App-level access control
3. **App Isolation**: Data scoping to prevent cross-app access
4. **Query Validation**: SQL injection prevention

### Performance Optimizations

1. **ClickHouse Partitioning**: Monthly partitions for efficient time-based queries
2. **Indexing**: Optimized ordering by app_id, event_name, and timestamp
3. **Query Optimization**: Efficient aggregation queries using ClickHouse functions
4. **Pagination**: Controlled result set sizes

## Benefits for Kijiweni

### 1. **User Insights**

- Track user engagement patterns
- Monitor user retention and churn
- Analyze user journey through the app
- Identify power users and inactive users

### 2. **Content Optimization**

- Measure episode performance
- Track completion rates
- Analyze user preferences
- Optimize content recommendations

### 3. **Business Intelligence**

- Monitor subscription conversions
- Track revenue metrics
